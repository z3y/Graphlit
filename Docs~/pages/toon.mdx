# Toon

Toon shaders are implmented using [Custom Lighting](./custom-lighting.mdx) instead having predetermined outputs like the PBR Lit graph.
This allows for much more control which is generally needed with toon.

This also works well with [Live Previews](./live-preview.mdx).
Options like outlines can't be controlled on the material so this way you can also enable them at the shader generation level.

## Sample Shader

You can start by modifying the sample `Create -> Graphlit -> Toon Graph` or fully implmenet it from scratch.

## Flat Lit

Use the Color output of the `Toon Light` node.
This node is based on Open Lit and returns averaged color of light probes and lights, which can be used as a base for toon shading.
This is already a fully functioning shader.
Enable Apply Shadows to receive realtime shadows.

## Shadow Layers

Add the `Toon Shadow Layers` node.

## Outlines

Enable outlines on the master node and use the `Outline Scale` node to scale them based on vertex normals.
Use the `Outline Pass Branch` to customize the outputs of the outline pass.
This can be used for example to set a different color for outlines from the base pass.

## Stylized Specular

Connect the Stylized Specular node to the Toon Light and output to Specular

## Transclipping

Using the Transclipping rendering mode you can fix certain transparency issues.
This mode allows receiving shadows.

## Audio Link

Use it to adjust any variable.
